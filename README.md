# Ao3-dyslexia, now with Colored Tagsâ„¢
This is a fork of electricalice's theme that adds colored tags to better tell each type (warning, relationship, character) apart, and makes small tweaks to the code based on my own preferences.

# Ao3-dyslexia
A dyslexia friendly skin for ArchiveOfOurOwn.org Presentation, previews, and installation guide [here directly on ArchiveofOurOwn](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30918077/chapters/76349072).

It was made by following the design guidelines by the [British Dyslexia Association Style Guide](https://www.bdadyslexia.org.uk/advice/employers/creating-a-dyslexia-friendly-workplace/dyslexia-friendly-style-guide).

##### The guide featured suggestions such as:

- Use a **Sans Serif** font
- a fairly **big font** size
- larger space between **words**
- larger space between **letters**
- **left align** for paragraphs, never justify
- the **paragraphs shouldn't be too wide**
- the paragraphs should be **well separated**
- **avoid underlining and italics** and **use bold** instead
- headings should be bigger and bolder

All of which I tried to follow with this skin.

##### An entire guide was devoted to this skin

So to have it be easy to personalize **even if you have never touched css or a coding language in your life**. Everything is explained in painstacking detail in the guide [here on Ao3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30918077/chapters/76349072).
