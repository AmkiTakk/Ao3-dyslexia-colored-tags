# Ao3-dyslexia, now with Colored Tagsâ„¢
This is a fork of electricalice's theme that adds colored tags to better tell each type (warning, relationship, character) apart, and makes small tweaks to the code based on my own preferences (namely, reverting italics so that they are italics again, instead of bold).
