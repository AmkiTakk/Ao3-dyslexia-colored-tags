# Ao3-dyslexia, now with Colored Tagsâ„¢
This is a fork of ElectricAlice's theme that adds colored tags to better tell each type (warning, relationship, character) apart, and makes small tweaks to the code based on my own preferences (namely, reverting italics so that they are italics again, instead of bold).

Files affected by my changes : 
- dyslexia.css
- dyslexia-dark.css
- dyslexia-sepia.css
- dyslexia-lowcontrast.css

# Installation
ElectricAlice has written an in-depth [guide](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30918077/chapters/76349072) explaining how to install the original theme on your account. Simply follow the instructions in that guide but with my files, it will work with my version as well. =)
